## üìñ Introduction

Welcome to the **Video Processing** section of my Computer Vision with OpenCV (`cv2`) prep for AI/ML interviews! üöÄ This folder builds on the **Core Image Processing** (e.g., `image_basics.py`) and **Advanced Image Processing** (e.g., `optical_flow.py`) sections, focusing on handling video data for motion analysis and object tracking. Designed for hands-on learning and interview success, it aligns with your prior roadmaps‚Äî**Python** (e.g., `neural_networks.py`), **TensorFlow.js** (e.g., `ai_ml_javascript.js`), **GenAI** (e.g., `rag.py`), **JavaScript**, **Keras**, **Matplotlib** (e.g., `basic_plotting.py`), **Pandas** (e.g., `basic_operations.py`), **NumPy** (e.g., `array_creation_properties.py`), **Core Image Processing**, and **Advanced Image Processing**‚Äîand supports your retail-themed projects (April 26, 2025). Whether tackling coding challenges or technical discussions, this section equips you with the skills to excel in computer vision roles.

## üåü What‚Äôs Inside?

- **Video Basics**: Read/write videos, extract frames, and access properties (FPS, resolution).
- **Video Analysis**: Perform frame differencing, background subtraction (MOG2, KNN), motion detection, and video stabilization.
- **Object Tracking**: Track objects using MeanShift, CamShift, KCF, and CSRT trackers.
- **Hands-on Code**: Three `.py` files with practical examples using synthetic video frames.
- **Interview Scenarios**: Key questions and answers to ace computer vision interviews.

## üîç Who Is This For?

- Computer Vision Engineers advancing video processing skills.
- Machine Learning Engineers exploring motion analysis.
- AI Researchers mastering object tracking.
- Software Engineers deepening computer vision expertise.
- Anyone preparing for video processing interviews in AI/ML or retail.

## üó∫Ô∏è Learning Roadmap

This section covers three key areas, each with a dedicated `.py` file:

### üìπ Video Basics (`video_basics.py`)
- Reading/Writing Videos
- Frame Extraction
- Video Properties (FPS, Resolution)

### üïí Video Analysis (`video_analysis.py`)
- Frame Differencing
- Background Subtraction (MOG2, KNN)
- Motion Detection
- Video Stabilization

### üèÉ Object Tracking (`object_tracking.py`)
- MeanShift
- CamShift
- KCF Tracker
- CSRT Tracker

## üí° Why Master Video Processing?

Video processing with OpenCV is essential for computer vision, and here‚Äôs why it matters:
1. **Dynamic Analysis**: Enables motion detection, tracking, and stabilization for real-world applications.
2. **Versatility**: Applies to retail (e.g., customer tracking), autonomous systems, and surveillance.
3. **Interview Relevance**: Tested in coding challenges (e.g., background subtraction, object tracking).
4. **Performance**: Optimized for real-time video with OpenCV‚Äôs C++ backend.
5. **Industry Demand**: A must-have for 6 LPA+ computer vision roles.

This section is your roadmap to mastering OpenCV‚Äôs video processing techniques for technical interviews‚Äîlet‚Äôs dive in!

## üìÜ Study Plan

- **Week 1**: Video Basics
- **Week 2**: Video Analysis
- **Week 3**: Object Tracking
- **Daily Practice**: Run one `.py` file, experiment with code, and review interview scenarios.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Python Environment**:
   - Install Python 3.8+ and pip.
   - Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv cv_env; source cv_env/bin/activate`.
   - Install dependencies: `pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib`.
2. **Datasets**:
   - Uses synthetic video frames (e.g., moving shapes) generated with NumPy/OpenCV.
   - Optional: Use real video files or webcam input (commented out; enable locally).
   - Download sample videos from [OpenCV Samples](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/samples/data).
3. **Running Code**:
   - Run `.py` files in a Python environment (e.g., `python video_basics.py`).
   - Use Google Colab for convenience or local setup.
   - View outputs in terminal (console logs) and Matplotlib windows (saved as PNGs).
   - Check terminal for errors; ensure dependencies are installed.
4. **Webcam** (Optional):
   - `object_tracking.py` can use webcam input for real-time tracking (commented out; enable locally).

## üèÜ Practical Tasks

1. **Video Basics**:
   - Extract frames from synthetic video frames and save as images.
   - Print FPS and resolution of a synthetic video sequence.
2. **Video Analysis**:
   - Detect motion using frame differencing on synthetic frames.
   - Apply MOG2 background subtraction to isolate moving objects.
3. **Object Tracking**:
   - Track a moving square with MeanShift in synthetic frames.
   - Use CSRT tracker to follow a synthetic object.

## üí° Interview Tips

- **Common Questions**:
  - How does MOG2 background subtraction work?
  - What‚Äôs the difference between MeanShift and CSRT trackers?
  - How would you stabilize a shaky video?
- **Tips**:
  - Explain background subtraction with code (e.g., `cv2.createBackgroundSubtractorMOG2()`).
  - Demonstrate tracking steps (e.g., initialize ROI ‚Üí track with CSRT).
  - Be ready to code tasks like frame differencing or MeanShift tracking.
  - Discuss trade-offs between trackers (e.g., speed vs. accuracy).
- **Coding Tasks**:
  - Implement frame differencing to detect motion.
  - Track an object using KCF tracker on synthetic frames.
  - Apply KNN background subtraction.
- **Conceptual Clarity**:
  - Explain why MOG2 is robust for dynamic backgrounds.
  - Describe how CamShift adapts to object size changes.

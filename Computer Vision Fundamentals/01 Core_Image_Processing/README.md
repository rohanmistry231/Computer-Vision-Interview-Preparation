## üìñ Introduction

Welcome to the **Core Image Processing** section of my Computer Vision with OpenCV (`cv2`) prep for AI/ML interviews! üöÄ This folder is your starting point for mastering the foundational techniques of computer vision using OpenCV, covering image basics, transformations, filtering, and color processing. Designed for hands-on learning and interview success, it builds on your prior roadmaps‚Äî**Python** (e.g., `neural_networks.py`), **TensorFlow.js** (e.g., `ai_ml_javascript.js`), **GenAI** (e.g., `rag.py`), **JavaScript**, **Keras**, **Matplotlib** (e.g., `basic_plotting.py`), **Pandas** (e.g., `basic_operations.py`), and **NumPy** (e.g., `array_creation_properties.py`)‚Äîand aligns with your retail-themed projects (April 26, 2025). Whether you‚Äôre preparing for coding challenges or technical discussions, this section equips you with the skills to shine in computer vision roles.

## üåü What‚Äôs Inside?

- **Image Basics**: Read/write images, manipulate pixels, and explore color spaces (RGB, HSV, Grayscale).
- **Image Transformations**: Resize, crop, rotate, flip, and apply affine/perspective transformations.
- **Image Filtering**: Apply blurring, sharpening, edge detection, thresholding, and morphological operations.
- **Color Processing**: Convert color spaces, filter colors, equalize histograms, and quantize colors.
- **Hands-on Code**: Four `.py` files with practical examples using synthetic images.
- **Interview Scenarios**: Key questions and answers to ace computer vision interviews.

2. **Versatility**: Applies to retail, autonomous systems, medical imaging, and more.
3. **Interview Relevance**: Tested in coding challenges (e.g., edge detection, color filtering).
4. **Performance**: Optimized for real-time applications with OpenCV‚Äôs C++ backend.
5. **Industry Demand**: A must-have for 6 LPA+ computer vision roles.

This section is your roadmap to mastering OpenCV‚Äôs core techniques for technical interviews‚Äîlet‚Äôs dive in!

## üìÜ Study Plan

- **Week 1**: Image Basics and Transformations
- **Week 2**: Image Filtering and Color Processing
- **Daily Practice**: Run one `.py` file, experiment with code, and review interview scenarios.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Python Environment**:
   - Install Python 3.8+ and pip.
   - Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv cv_env; source cv_env/bin/activate`.
   - Install dependencies: `pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib`.
2. **Datasets**:
   - Uses synthetic images generated with NumPy/OpenCV (e.g., rectangles, gradients).
   - Optional: Download sample images from [OpenCV Samples](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/samples/data).
3. **Running Code**:
   - Run `.py` files in a Python environment (e.g., `python image_basics.py`).
   - Use Google Colab for convenience or local setup.
   - View outputs in terminal (console logs) and Matplotlib windows (saved as PNGs).
   - Check terminal for errors; ensure dependencies are installed.

## üèÜ Practical Tasks

1. **Image Basics**:
   - Load a synthetic image and convert it to Grayscale and HSV.
   - Modify pixel values to create a red square.
2. **Image Transformations**:
   - Resize a synthetic image to half its size and rotate it by 45 degrees.
   - Apply an affine transformation to skew the image.
3. **Image Filtering**:
   - Apply Gaussian blur and Canny edge detection to a synthetic pattern.
   - Perform binary thresholding on a grayscale image.
4. **Color Processing**:
   - Filter the blue channel from a synthetic RGB image.
   - Apply histogram equalization to enhance contrast.

## üí° Interview Tips

- **Common Questions**:
  - What‚Äôs the difference between RGB and HSV color spaces?
  - How does Canny edge detection work, and what are its parameters?
  - Why use morphological operations in image processing?
- **Tips**:
  - Explain color space conversions with code (e.g., `cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)`).
  - Demonstrate edge detection with clear steps (e.g., blur ‚Üí Canny).
  - Be ready to code tasks like resizing or thresholding.
  - Discuss trade-offs between filter types (e.g., Gaussian vs. Bilateral).
- **Coding Tasks**:
  - Convert an RGB image to Grayscale and display it.
  - Implement Sobel edge detection on a synthetic image.
  - Apply dilation to a binary image.
- **Conceptual Clarity**:
  - Explain why HSV is useful for color filtering.
  - Describe how adaptive thresholding differs from binary thresholding.
